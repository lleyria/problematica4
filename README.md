Version 1.0.1 Code and samples of the html structure and a javascript logical algoritms of the fourth "Probleamtica Semanal" from the Become a software developer course.
In this code i try to resolve the problems described in the Classroom using arrays, sentences and bucles (such as for and if), the js predeterminated functions (typeof, lenght), logical and mathematical opeartors. 
The last exercise was the correct logical process of thought definition, syntaxis and execution of my own functions to solve correclty the problems.
One of the determinate things in wich i focused was the internalization of the so called "Buenas Pr√°cticas" of the java script logial lenguage.
These good practices suchs as proxily, coherence and adaptability are not strictly requiered to be a programer but neccesary to be a good programer and make individual and group work more efficient
